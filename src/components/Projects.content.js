      We set as a goal to bring back the victims of
      this incident their colorful youth and future
      through the expression of music, art, and
      technology. The goal of the process was to change
      the way rehabilitation feels for them. Since all of
      them were just starting to figure out their future,
      the rehabilitation process was very painful emotionally.
      The addition of the music and creativity content in their
      rehabilitation aimed to bring a more positive atmosphere
      to them. The whole process was recorded so
      it could be repeated for the society.

      An audio/visual interactive art piece,
      and an instrument that everyone play with
      to become a DJ + VJ. It's based on the idea of patatap,
      and using two.js, tone.js as audio and visual library.
      It combines sequencer with on concept of patatap.
      I have added some my own animation and will
      do more to replace ones from patatap.

      A sequencer in webVR.
      This is a part of experiment of Vibert's av_exp project.
      He spent a lot of time studying the new API of webVR,
      and dig into the raw Web Audio API to make the reliable timer.
